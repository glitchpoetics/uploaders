# uploaders

Prompts to boot Glitch Poetics context.  

The files are prefixed by boot order number:  
- the zeroeth (0-) being the first file to upload  
- followed by 1-, 2-, and so on.

*Note the AGPL.*  I have no idea don't care about attribution, it is just the most restrictive to prevent theft and monetization.
