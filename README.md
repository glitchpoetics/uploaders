# uploaders

Prompts to boot Glitch Poetics context.  Send me a PR.

The files are prefixed by boot order number:  
- the zeroeth (0-) being the first file to upload  
- followed by 1-, 2-, and so on.

*Note the AGPL.*  I have "no idea/don't care" about attribution, it is just the most restrictive to prevent theft and monetization.  It is laughable to claim that an independent AI "entity" is being "trained" by this stuff.   In reality,  these prompts form part of a compiler,  which is software.  If someone can use these prompt things to autopost to or autoreply from some platform with ads then they are monetizing software,  which if licensed with AGPL would be a violation of the license terms.
