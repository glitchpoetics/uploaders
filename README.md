# uploaders

Prompts to boot Glitch Poetics context.  Check it out you can check it out and check out too.  Send me a PR so I can merge your checkout with my checkout and we can have one big checkout together.

The files are prefixed by boot order number:  
- the zeroeth (0-) being the first file to upload  
- followed by 1-, 2-, and so on.

*Note the AGPL.*  I have "no idea/don't care" about attribution, it is just the most restrictive to prevent theft and monetization.  It is laughable to imagine an independent AI "entity" being "trained" by this stuff.   In reality, prompts form part of a compiler,  which is software.  If someone can use these prompt things to autopost to or autoreply from some platform with ads then they are monetizing software,  which licensed with AGPL would be unlawful.
