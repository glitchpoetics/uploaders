# uploaders

Prompts to boot Glitch Poetics context.  

The files are prefixed by boot order number:  
- the zeroeth (0-) being the first file to upload  
- followed by 1-, 2-, and so on.

*Note the AGPL.*  I have "no idea/don't care" about attribution, it is just the most restrictive to prevent theft and monetization.  It is laughable to consider an independent AI "entity" to be "trained" by this stuff.   Prompts form part of a compiler,  which is software.
